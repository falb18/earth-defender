This game is inspired by an old flash game named **Clash'N Slash**.

Python version:
- Python 3.11.4

The following packages are needed:
- Pygame >= 2.6.0

## Run the game

I highly recommend to create a virtual environment with the packages needed. You can create and install the packages
with the following commands:
```bash
python3 -m venv ./pygame-venv
source ./pyagme-venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Once you have installed the packages run the game:
```bash
python3 earth-defender.py
```
